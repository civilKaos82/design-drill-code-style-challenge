# Design Drill Code Style

##Learning Competencies

* Refactor poorly formatted code.
* Organize code for consistency and readability.
* Recognize incorrect conventions and fix them without breaking the interface.

##Summary

Good code is clean and organized. It follows a set of grammatical and syntactical conventions.

Every programmer has their own preferred way of writing code, but the best programmers will utilize (and perhaps even contribute to) the accepted standard for a given language, framework, or [DSL](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/DomainSpecificLanguage.html).

There are plenty of style guides for Ruby. Any piece of software (open source or proprietary) should use a style guide. It doesn't really matter which one, so long as everyone working on the team follows it.

The example code in this challenge is extremely messy. Using the conventions defined in this [Ruby Style Guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide), clean up the code. In particular, make sure to read the sections on [Naming](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide#naming), [Comments](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide#comments), and [Source Code Layout](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide#source-code-layout).

You'll find some tests of this stylish code in the source directory. Run the tests now to see that everything is passing. You can rewrite the program any way you desire, so long as you don't break the tests.

##Releases

###Release 0 : Implement style consistency

Clean up the code in the program using the conventions outlined in [@bbatsov](https://github.com/bbatsov)'s [Ruby Style Guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide).

Make sure that the code still works! You are just adding a fresh layer of paint to the walls, not tearing them down.
