# Design Drill: Code Style

## Summary
Good code is clean and organized. It follows a set of grammatical and syntactical conventions.  The best programmers follow the accepted standard for a given language, framework, or [domain specific language](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/DomainSpecificLanguage.html).  As we continue to write code, we'll probably develop a personal style, but we should stay within conventions.

Whether it's open source or proprietary, any piece of software should use a style guide, which its contributors should follow.  For a Ruby project, there are plenty of style guides from which to choose.  Which style guide is selected isn't as important as everyone on the team following it.

In this challenge, we'll practice refactoring code to match a given style guide.


##Releases

###Release 0 : Implement style consistency
The example code in this challenge is extremely messy. Using the conventions defined in this [Ruby Style Guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide), clean up the code. In particular, make sure to read the sections on [Naming](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide#naming), [Comments](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide#comments), and [Source Code Layout](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide#source-code-layout).

You'll find some tests of this stylish code in the source directory. Run the tests now to see that everything is passing. You can rewrite the program any way you desire, so long as you don't break the tests.


Clean up the code in the program using the conventions outlined in [@bbatsov](https://github.com/bbatsov)'s [Ruby Style Guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide).

Make sure that the code still works! You are just adding a fresh layer of paint to the walls, not tearing them down.
